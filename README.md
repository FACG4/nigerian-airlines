#### Our application is about :
Automation the process of airline operations:
* Updating the information about flight is hard and take alot of time since it is done manually which includes alot of repeated work.
* Communicate routes and flights details to customers.

#### The problem :
No way to notify the customers if there any changes in their flights,
no scheduling for flights 'add/update', view flights details manually, and hard way to Communicate with customers when there any changes in the flights information.
#### user stories :
###### As an admin I can :
* Log in to control panel.
* See all flights details.
* Add new flight with it is details.
* Update flight status 'Change flight status gate number etc'.
* Send updates for customers via email or text.
###### As a customer I can :
* Track my flight by enter flight date and flight number.
* Check if I want to get the updates for my flight via email or text.
* After checking, Enter my email address or phone number or both.
* See my flight route and origin/destination details.
* Track my flight from tack off to landing.
